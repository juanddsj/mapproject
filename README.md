I want to write a review of the Steven Spielberg remake of Westside Story. I want to focus on the representation on the film of the tension between English and Spanish for the Puerto Ricans and their migrant experience from the island to New York or growing up here. I will use the map of the number of households in New york that speak only Spanish and only English to illustrate the importance of Spanish in this city, might aswell use the map of the number of households that only speak Spanish in the whole country, to illustrate that Spanish is not and has never been a foreing language in this country and yet speaking with an accent or with a different grammar is still a reason for discrimination from the supposed “natives” of the country that, as in the movie, use language as a way to turn a community into “other”, into second class citizens, into someone with less power and less deserving of citizen rights. Also will speak about how for migrants is so important to learn the language to try to blend in the new culture in order to be treated better and how many in many homes of spanish backgrounds Spanish is sometimes prohibited to ensure that second generations and following will have better opportunities in the US, trying to protect them from discrimination.
