        <p>In the early seventies, at age 14, Albert Troche played the role of Bernardo in his South Bronx high school adaptation of the musical “West Side Story”. By that time he was already a fan of the play and the movie, his parents teached him to love them by telling him the stories of how Nueva York was like when they first moved here from Puerto Rico in the fifties.
</p>

        <p>“There were gangs all over Nueva York fighting for the dominance of the territory”, Albert recalls, from the stories their parents used to tell him from the late 50s and the early 60s, a time when puertorriqueños were coming in great numbers to New York after World War II, starting to organize and being recognized as a particular group in the city. In the words of Puerto Rican filmmaker Frances Negrón-Muntaner, “West Side Story” is in a way the first and still the most influential story portraying Puerto Ricans and telling people who they are and how they behave and what they look like”.

</p>

<p>The movie portrays Boricuas setting the template of what it was going to be like being Latino and speaking Spanish in Nueva York. Albert Troche is thrilled that the movie was remade by, in his opinion, the best American Movie director alive, making the effort to fix everything that needed to be fixed on the original film from 1961. The original won 10 Academy awards in spite of having a cast with only one Puerto Rican actress, Rita Moreno, first Latina to win an Oscar. The cast was blackfaced to make the actors look more “Latinos”, and their accent was adjacent to the caricature. Bobby Sanabria, musician of Puerto Rican background in charge of the music of the remake, says “everything that might still be wrong with the new West Side Story, blame it on Shakespeare. At the end of the day it is based on Romeo and Juliet, which is already a dated story.” </p>

<p>What is not dated is the story that the movie actually tells beyond Shakespeare, the story of people coming to the so called America, trying to make their dreams come true, escaping from poverty, from presecustion, trying to save their lives, from hometowns where things are not going well. People being forced to the exilio, moving to the so-called land of freedom. Albert says bringing back the movie right now is powerful because it brings attention to Puerto Rico, an island that in his words “has been brought to its knees”, devastated after the Maria hurricane, with people moving to Nueva York in the same amount than in the fifties.
</p>

<p>“West Side Story” portrays that experience, Puerto Rican migration to Nueva York which is in great part the experience of speaking Spanish here. Black Puerto Rican actress Ariana de Bose, who plays Anita in the movie, says she is proud that there is actual Spanish in the movie without subtitles: “It’s so nice to see a film that does not ‘other’ the language. In American society, we're like, ‘Well, English is our first language and everything else is secondary,’ when the reality is that it's actually not true in today's world.”
</p>

<p>In West Side Story, in several scenes that happen in the apartment where Anita lives as a family with her boyfriend Bernardo and his sister Maria, you can listen to Anita asking them to speak English, even in that intimate environment, even to discuss family matters, cause she feels they need to learn to communicate in English even for their private emotions if they wanna have a chance to make it in la Selva de Cemento. If they want to access the opportunities that Nueva York has to offer if you speak English.
</p>

<p>Albert Troche recalls that as a child he was discriminated against and attacked by white students in his high school for speaking Spanish. “I used to speak only Spanish at home, my older brothers already had experienced the outside world so they already spoke English. When I started school it was a time where racial hatred in America was so intense, this is just 10 years after Martin Luther King Jr. “I have a Dream” speech”.
</p>

<p>At home, as Albert says, you would speak Spanish, an experience that he shares with the people represented in this map, the households in Nueva York that speak Spanish and English “less than well”.

        <p>What is it like to speak English less than well in Nueva York? Albert recalls he was called “Speak”, a word that is used along the new version of West Side Story when the white gang wants to establish their superiority over the Puerto Rican gang, to let them know that they are some sort of invaders in Manhattan. As Ariana DeBose explained, that Latinos are “other” to this territory and that they should speak English even to have the chance to talk back in a fight. Albert explains: “Speak” was like calling someone the N word, it is a derogatory term to make fun of the pronunciation of Spanish speakers”. Maybe that is why is so powerful that in the new “West Side Story”, after being called “Speak” and commanded to respond in English to the Jets (the white gang) offenses, the Sharks (Puerto Rican gang) respond by singing, in Spanish, of course, “La Borinqueña”, the original anthem of Puerto Rico.
        </p>

<p>Albert recalls that by third grade and with the help of a Jewish and a Black American teachers that really took the time to teach him English, by the time he was 14 and got the role of Bernardo in his high school musical, he was as proficient in English as a college student. So he was able to capture the essence of a character that in Albert’s words was so similar to him: “you know, a young trigueñito (brown) boy with straight hair, raised by a Spanish family and educated in the English American school system”.
</p>
        <p>Spanish at home and English in the “outside world”. Spanish for the private, and English for the public decisions. Decisions are made in the United States only in English even though Spanish is by far the most dominant language in the United States after English. There are approximately 35 million Spanish speakers in the US, most of them in New York, Chicago and Los Angeles. In Nueva York, by April 20th last year, hispanic community had the biggest rate of deaths for COVID-19. The instructions to wash your hands properly and save yourself from COVID-19 were posted only in English at the beginning of the pandemic. According to the New York Times, “hispanic community might have been discouraged from seeking health care because of the anti-immigrant rhetoric that has dominated the national discourse in recent years”. The Trump administration, among many other anti-immigrant decisions, erased the Spanish version of the White House website.

<p>Albert says that in the America post Trump, bringing back “West Side Story” is so important, specially in a moment where America is behaving like the gangs of New York in the 50s: “there might not be actual gangs now, but you have the Republican, the Democrats, the right, the left, fighting each other, mistreating each other, calling each other bad names, waiting for their chance in power so they can smash the little guy”.
</p>

<p>And the little guys right now in New York are often the ones that only speak Spanish, the ones that speak English “less than well”, the ones that as you can see in the map are concentrated in the Bronx and in Jackson Heights in Queens. The 2 areas where it is more affordable to live in NYC for somebody that only speaks Spanish? Both areas have the highest rate of deaths for covid. In New York the hispanic community reports every year the most new cases of HIV. Hispanic women with kids have found it harder than any other community in the city to find a job again after COVID. If you don't speak English in New York everything is harder and yet there are more and more people speaking Spanish, but not the people in power.
</p>

<p>The former might be changing a little,  thanks to The Deliveristas Unidos, the union of delivery men from Guatemala, those in charge of bringing food to the New York homes with the privilege of affording a delivery, are leading a movement that might be the most important political labor movement that is happening in the US right now. The ones in charge of keeping New Yorkers fed, the so called essential workers who didn't have the chance to stay home during the highest peak of covid in NYC, had to go to the streets several times this last year to protest and fight for very basic rights like being able to use the bathroom in the restaurants they work with or to force the apps they work with to give them their tips. Thanks to raising their voice in Spanish, last Sept. 23rd, the City Council passed a set of bills to ensure those rights for Los Deliveristas Unidos, leading the regulation of delivery labor in the US.
</p>

<p>Albert says latinos in the US are a force to be reckoned with and that in great part thanks to Puerto Ricans New York is a little easier to navigate for people that only speak Spanish. He recalls the work of the Young Lords, the latino chapter of Black Panthers, very unknown in mainstream political culture in the US and yet is thanks to them that the Subway has a Spanish version of their instruction posts or hospitals have the obligation to have Spanish versions of their forms, just to mention a couple of the things they conquered for the Hispanic community in New York.
</p>

<p>“La calle es una selva de cemento” (the street is a concrete jungle) is the opening line of Juanito Alimaña by Hector Lavoe and Willie Colon, one of the biggest classics of Salsa, a music genre born in Nueva York thanks to the influence of Puerto Rican culture here, an influence that also helped shaped Hip Hop. Juanito Alimaña is the story of a latino delinquent, killed in the streets of New york. Recently Jay Z also used that New York nickname in his song “Empire State of Mind”: “Concrete jungle where dreams are made of”. The reference comes originally from the 1960 film “The concrete jungle”, that depicts a harsh and violent portrayal of prison life that led to the film being banned in several countries. And yes a city like New York can be a place where dreams come true but also a jail for the communities that have it harder here. That is the tragedy told in West Side Story, at the end the movie portrays, in a very Shakespearean way,  that it seems like there is no escape or chance for love in a system structured to oppress the “little guys”.
</p>

<p>Movements like the Young Lords or Los Deliveristas Unidos are beacons of hope, a representation that from uniting and fighting together, there might be a scape from tragedy and a way to give the Hispanic community a chance to be more than an exploited labor force and to have an everytime more visible and stronger vote and voice in the political decisions of the US.
